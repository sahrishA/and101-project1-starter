# AND101 Project 1 - Hello, Squirrel!

Submitted by: **Sahrish Afzal**

Time spent: **3** hours spent in total

## Summary

**and101-project1-starter** is an Android app that recreates the classic "Hello, World!" experience with a fun twist — introducing ourselves to the neighborhood squirrel 🐿. **It’s a light-hearted way to learn the basics of Android development while sharing a bit about who we are, what we love, and how we spend our time.**

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be: **🌍🐿🎨**

Explanation of emojis:

🌍 – Representing "Hello, World!" and global connection

🐿 – The neighborhood squirrel and friendly interaction

🎨 – A nod to personal hobbies and creativity
